                            Our founder, Steve Orr, spent his early days as an investment banker. Specializing in the
                            financial sector at Goldman Sachs, he recognized the power of data and analytics to drive
                            change, growth, and creative thinking. After more than a decade on Wall Street, inspired by
                            a desire to make the world a better place, and by his own parents' philanthropy, Steve and
                            his wife Carol founded Orr Group (previously known as Orr Associates, Inc.).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From our beginnings as an event management and fundraising firm, Orr Group evolved into a
                            full-service embedded partnership pioneer. We offer our nonprofit partners a broad range of
                            expertise and capabilities, from working at the highest levels of leadership and strategic
                            planning to providing granular day-to-day support and implementation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the key lessons Steve took away from Goldman Sachs was that “it's all about the
                            team.” Orr Group pioneered the embedded partnership model. We launch every client
                            relationship by joining your team, listening carefully to your leaders and stakeholders, and
                            ensuring that we embrace your mission and goals from the inside out. Then we roll up our
                            sleeves and get to work on building strategy, stability, and revenue. It all starts with
                            building your trust in us.
